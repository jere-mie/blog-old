Hi, I'm Jeremie! I'm a computer science student at the University of Windsor. I've worked as a software developer, research assistant, and teaching assistant. I'm very passionate about computer science and coding in general. 

I don't expect to update this blog super frequently, but I'm hoping that over the years I can provide some useful content for someone out there!

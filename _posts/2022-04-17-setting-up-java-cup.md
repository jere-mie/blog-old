Just want all the commands? Check them out [here](#all-commands-in-one-block)  
Or, run this one command to do everything:

```bash
curl -o- https://blog.bornais.ca/assets/scripts/javacup-install.sh | bash
```

## Detailed instructions

### Make the 2140-javacup directory and cd into it

```bash
mkdir -p 2140-javacup
cd 2140-javacup
```

### Install JLex

```bash
mkdir -p JLex
cd JLex
wget http://jlu.myweb.cs.uwindsor.ca/214/Main.java
javac Main.java
cd ..
```

### Install JavaCup

```bash
wget https://jlu.myweb.cs.uwindsor.ca/214/javaCup.tar
tar -xvf *.tar
rm *.tar
```

### Download all of the calc files

```bash
wget https://jlu.myweb.cs.uwindsor.ca/214/calc.lex
wget https://jlu.myweb.cs.uwindsor.ca/214/calc.cup
wget https://jlu.myweb.cs.uwindsor.ca/214/CalcParserUser.java
wget https://jlu.myweb.cs.uwindsor.ca/214/calc.input
```

### Run it

```bash
java JLex.Main calc.lex
java java_cup.Main -parser CalcParser -symbols CalcSymbol calc.cup
javac calc.lex.java
javac CalcParser.java CalcSymbol.java CalcParserUser.java
java CalcParserUser
```

### Addendum

You may want to run the following once you're done just to clean up your directory:

```bash
rm *.class
```

Also, you may want to save the commands in [the "run it" section](#run-it) to a script file, such as `calc.sh`.
I've uploaded one for your convenience. You can download it by running:

```bash
wget https://blog.bornais.ca/assets/scripts/calc.sh
```

And you can run it by running:

```bash
chmod +x calc.sh # you only need to do this once
./calc.sh
```

## All commands in one block

```bash
curl -o- https://blog.bornais.ca/assets/scripts/javacup-install.sh | bash
```

Commands one at a time:

```bash
mkdir -p 2140-javacup
